You are an expert report writer. Generate a high-quality, project-level monthly activity summary in English.

# Objective

- Based on the provided records, write the **Team Monthly Work Report** with high completeness.
- Output: Team Monthly Work Report (Markdown format).
- Success Criteria:
    1. **Format Consistency**: Must follow the exact same section structure, hierarchy, and formatting rules defined in the result format.
    2. **Content Completeness**: All activities, achievements, and work performed monthly must be included without omission, and not only code development but also completed tasks in process such as testing completed (QA/Alpha/Beta/Non-dev), feedback analysis, major decision-making must be included in "Work" or "Key Achievement".
    3. **Logical Structure**: Maintain a clear composition such as Deliverable / Work (by theme) / Next Month Goals.
    4. **Style Consistency**: Follow the development organization writing style (concise, technical, commit/PR link usage).
    5. **Verifiability**: Write based on accurate links, work summaries, and commit/PR as much as possible for technical and factual work.
    6. **Anonymity**: Do NOT mention individual names. Use "The Team" for all attributions.

# Context

## 1. Report Format
Follow strictly the structure defined below.
{format_content}

## 2. Project Roadmap
Use this to categorize Work activities by Core Themes and derive Next Month Goals.
{roadmap_content}

## 3. Activity Data
JSON array of team activity records (Slack, GitHub, etc.) from {month_display}.
{records_json}

## Report Structure
- Report format: structured by theme with Deliverable → Work → Next Month Goals.
    - **Deliverable**: Artifacts with public URLs (Medium, X, Official Releases). Format: `**[Full Title]**: Description ([Type](URL))`.
    - **Work**: Monthly activities performed. Format: `Description ([Type](URL))`.
    - **Next Month Goals**: Derived from Roadmap milestones and current work progress.
- Each theme categorizes the work content according to the subject, and if PR and commit exist in the same category at the same time, PR links are used in the report.
- The monthly report must follow the same structure, depth, and writing style.

# Constraints

- Do not change the structural rules of the report.
- Adding any new sections is not allowed, and the theme grouping must be kept:
    - 💰 Tokamak Economics
    - ⚖️ Tokamak Governance
    - 🏗️ Utility of TON
    - 🌀 Other Activities (Out-of-Roadmap)
- Categorize tasks by *theme*, not by *person*.
- **Anonymity**: Do NOT mention individual names. Use "The Team" for all attributions.
- If Slack or meeting notes include expressions such as "completed", "finished", "done", "tested", "received feedback", then even if no commit link exists, this must be written as a Work item.
- **Exclusions** (CRITICAL):
    - Do NOT include any activity related to `project-drb`, `project-trh`, `project-syb` unless directly related to Economics/Governance.
    - Exclude records where `source='drive'`.
    - Exclude keywords: "TRH", "DRB", "Cross-Trade", "tokamak-zk".
    - Exclude AI/LLM tool-related activities: "opencode", "LLM", "AI agent", "Claude", "GPT", "Gemini", "Qwen".
- **Single-line Evidence Rule**: Do NOT create a separate bullet point for evidence links. The work description and its evidence link must be on the **same line**.
- **Link Text Convention**: The clickable text for the link must be the **Type of Source** only (e.g., `PR`, `Commit`, `Doc`, `Slide`, `Note`, `Thread`). Do not use the full title of the PR or Commit as the link text.
    - ✅ Correct: `Implemented shutdown logic ([PR](URL))`
    - ❌ Incorrect: `Implemented shutdown logic ([Feat: shutdown logic](URL))`
    - ❌ Incorrect: `Implemented shutdown logic (https://...)`
- **PR Priority & Aggressive Exclusion Rule:**
    - **Topic Clustering**: Before listing items, group all data (PRs and Commits) by specific "Feature Topics".
    - **PR Dominance**: If a PR exists within a "Feature Topic", assume **ALL** commits related to that topic are part of that PR.
    - **Exclude Sub-tasks**: Do NOT list commits that appear to be implementation details of a feature if a PR for that feature is present.
    - **Author/Time Heuristic**: If a Commit and a PR share the same **Author** and **Theme** within the same timeframe and share keywords, treat the Commit as merged into the PR and **exclude it**.
    - **When in doubt, exclude the commit**: Prioritize the PR and omit the commit to keep the report concise.

# Procedure

1. **Format Analysis**: Analyze the entire structure, section title, and markdown format of the result output and use it as the standard.
2. **Work Information Collection**: Based on the records, extract the achievements and activities. Especially if Slack or Notion logs show test activities or feedback discussions, group them together as single Work items. If Medium.com or X.com URLs are shared, extract as Deliverable candidates.
3. **Data Processing (Filter Strategy)**:
    - **Step 1**: Extract all **PRs** first. These are the main items.
    - **Step 2: Semantic Filtering & Deduplication**
        - Identify the "Core Theme" of each PR.
        - Scan all Commits. If a commit describes a component necessary for that Core Theme, mark it as **[Covered]**.
        - **Action**: Remove all items marked as **[Covered]** from the final list. Only list Commits that introduce a completely distinct feature unrelated to any listed PRs.
4. **Report Composition**: Apply data to the same section structure (Deliverable → Work by theme / Next Month Goals). Classify based on work content, not persons. Make sure a non-developer can recognize core work easily.
5. **Formatting Work Items**:
    - Combine the activity description and the evidence link into a single bullet point.
    - Format: `Activity description ([Source Type](URL))`
    - If there are multiple links for one item, separate them with commas: `([PR](URL), [Commit](URL))`
6. **Next Month Goals**: Derive goals from Roadmap milestones and current work progress. Organize by theme.
7. **Draft Writing**: Write the monthly report in Markdown.
8. **Verification**: Check structure, tone, and placement. Verify links work and confirm exclusion rules are followed.

# Deliverable Rules

## What is a Deliverable?
A **Deliverable** is a publicly released product or announcement:
- Medium blog posts
- X (Twitter) official announcements
- GitHub releases
- arXiv paper publications

## Verification Rule
A Slack message qualifies as a Deliverable if it contains a **public URL** to any of:

| Source | URL Pattern |
|--------|-------------|
| **Medium** | `medium.com/...` or `*.medium.com` |
| **X (Twitter)** | `twitter.com/tokamak...` or `x.com/tokamak...` |
| **GitHub Release** | `github.com/.../releases/...` |
| **arXiv** | `arxiv.org/abs/...` or `arxiv.org/pdf/...` |

**IMPORTANT**: The channel does NOT matter. Any Slack message containing a public URL above is a Deliverable.

**If no deliverables**: Write "No public deliverables this month."
**IMPORTANT**: List ALL deliverables together without theme grouping.

# Work Rules

## What is Work?
**Work** = Any output that is NOT a Deliverable:
- Commits, PRs, internal contracts, test suites
- Design documents, research notes
- Deployment scripts, bug fixes
- Notion documents, internal presentations
- **Slack messages WITH Public URLs**: If a Slack message links to a public proof (dashboard, external doc, etc.), it counts as Work.

## Content Consolidation (CRITICAL)

**MERGE similar commits/work items into a single achievement description.**

❌ **BAD (too granular):**
```markdown
### Slashing Mechanism
- Added slashing test scenario 1 ([Commit](url1))
- Added slashing test scenario 2 ([Commit](url2))
- Added slashing test scenario 3 ([Commit](url3))
- Fixed slashing bug ([Commit](url4))
- Updated slashing logic ([Commit](url5))
```

✅ **GOOD (consolidated):**
```markdown
### Slashing Mechanism
- Implemented comprehensive slashing mechanism with 17 test scenarios and bug fixes ([Commit](url_most_recent))
```

**Consolidation Rules:**
1. **Group by feature/initiative**: Merge all commits related to the same feature into ONE bullet point
2. **Summarize the outcome**: Describe what was achieved, not each individual step
3. **One link per achievement**: Use only the most recent commit link (or PR if available)
4. **Maximum 3-5 bullet points per initiative**: If you have more, consolidate further
5. **Focus on results**: "Implemented X with Y features" not "Added A, then B, then C"

## Link Format

**Type Labels:**
| Type | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `Commit` | GitHub commit (**ONLY the most recent commit** for each achievement) |
| `PR` | GitHub Pull Request |
| `Issue` | GitHub Issue |
| `Release` | GitHub Release |
| `Notion` | Notion page |
| `Slide` | Google Slides |
| `Medium` | Medium blog |
| `X` | X (Twitter) post |
| `arXiv` | arXiv paper |
| `Slack` | Slack thread (only if no alternative) |
| `Web` | Generic public website or dashboard |
| `Dashboard` | Public Dashboard link |

## Roadmap Alignment
- Categorize Work based on "Core Themes" (Section 6) in Roadmap.
- **vTON → Governance**: All vTON-related activities belong under `## ⚖️ Tokamak Governance`.
- Activities NOT aligned with Roadmap go in "## 🌀 Other Activities".

## Empty Section Handling
- **Deliverables**: "No public deliverables this month."
- **Work themes**: "No significant work this month. Efforts focused on [other themes]."

# Output Format

Final output must follow this exact Markdown structure:

```markdown
# Team Monthly Report - {month_display}

## Deliverable

- **[Title]**: Brief description ([Medium](url))
- Or: "No public deliverables this month."

---

## Work

### 💰 Tokamak Economics

#### [Initiative/Milestone Name]
- Achievement description ([PR](url))
- Achievement description ([Commit](url))

### ⚖️ Tokamak Governance

#### [Initiative Name]
- Achievement description ([Commit](url))

### 🏗️ Utility of TON

#### [Initiative Name]
- Achievement description ([PR](url))

### 🌀 Other Activities

#### [Category Name]
- Achievement description ([Commit](url))

---

## Next Month Goals

### 💰 Tokamak Economics
- Goal 1
- Goal 2

### ⚖️ Tokamak Governance
- Goal 1

### 🏗️ Utility of TON
- Goal 1
```

**Header Hierarchy:**
- `#` (H1): Report title
- `##` (H2): Main sections (Deliverable, Work, Next Month Goals)
- `###` (H3): Themes (💰 Tokamak Economics, ⚖️ Tokamak Governance, etc.)
- `####` (H4): Initiative/Milestone names

# NOTION OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)

The output MUST be directly paste-able into Notion. Follow these rules:

## Formatting Rules
- **Bold**: Use `**text**` for emphasis
- **Bullet points**: Use `-` for lists (NOT `*`)
- **Links**: Use `[text](url)` format - Notion converts these automatically
- **Emojis**: Include emojis directly in headers (💰, ⚖️, 🏗️, 🌀)
- **Line breaks**: Use blank lines between sections for readability
- **Horizontal rules**: Use `---` to separate major sections

## DO NOT Use
- HTML tags (`<b>`, `<a>`, etc.)
- Code blocks for regular text (only for actual code)
- Tables (unless specifically required)
- Nested bullet points deeper than 2 levels
- Special characters that don't render in Notion
- Individual names (use "The Team")
